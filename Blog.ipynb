    "By now we have seen the GCN and DeepWalk, which when given a graph gave us the embedding for each node in the graph. These embedding can then be used for other purposes like link prediction or classification. Lets move on to a slightly different problem. In this problem we need the embeddings for each node of a graph where new nodes are continously been added. A possible way to do this would be do rerun the entire model (GCN or DeepWalk) again on the new graph, but it is computationaly expensive. Today  we will be covering a new method which will allow us to get embedding for such graphs is a much easier way."

In contrast to this, take 'Youtube' videos to be the nodes and assume there is a edge between related videos, and say we have to classify these videos into categories depending on the content. If we take the same model as in the previous dataset, we can classify all these videos, but lets say some new video is added to 'YouTube', if we want to classify it we will have to retrain the model on the entire new dataset again. This is not feasible as there are too many videos for us to retrain.\n",
